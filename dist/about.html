          <p>
            I am 18 years old. I always had an interest in technology.
            Programming/Coding makes me elated and helps me undertand the way
            computers work. I dream to work in FANG(Facebook, Amazon, Netflix,
            Google), My mantra is to work hard until the work bends in front of
            you and you overcome it.

            I am working on a neural network that can advise the user a song
            according to one's interests. The interests will be stored using
            PostGreSQL and then the neural network on the basis of its data will
            suggest the appropriate song.
